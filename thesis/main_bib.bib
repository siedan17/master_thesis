  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to },

abstract = {A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the
decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the
classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions.
The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity
of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns.
These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary.
Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the
VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems
demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.},

has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes
an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems,
and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show
ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy
and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and
two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of
current research directions.},
